Write a thread-safe decorator class profile that will compute the functionâ€™s execution time and number of calls for a bubble-sort function.
Measure the execution time of the multi-threaded program from exercise 1-6 with profile decorator.
Compare this execution time with the execution time of a single-threaded large factorial function.
